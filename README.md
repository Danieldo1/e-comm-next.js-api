## Project Overview Welcome to the E-Comm Next.js Test Project!
 This website, has been created to provide an immersive and hands-on learning experience in the world of web development, specifically focusing on API calls and Next.js, a powerful React framework. This project showcases the effective use of Next.js and its routing system to fetch product details from the Fakestore API. It demonstrates how Next.js seamlessly integrates APIs and handles dynamic content rendering. 
 
## Key Features 

### 1. Developed with Next.js This project is developed entirely using the Next.js framework. Next.js is known for its server-side rendering capabilities, which enhance performance and search engine optimization. It simplifies the creation of React applications, making it an excellent choice for web development. 
### 2. Utilizes Next.js Routing System The website harnesses Next.js's built-in routing system. This system simplifies the management of pages and their corresponding routes. It ensures that users can easily navigate between different sections of the website while maintaining a smooth and snappy user experience. 
### 3. Retrieves Details from the Fakestore API The heart of this project is the integration with the Fakestore API. It retrieves product information, including titles, descriptions, prices, and images. The API integration is a valuable demonstration of how Next.js can seamlessly connect with external data sources, making it ideal for building dynamic web applications.
